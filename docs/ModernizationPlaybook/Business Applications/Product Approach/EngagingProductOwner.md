# Engaging the Product Owner
â€‹
![Engaging the Product Owner]
The role of the product owner is to set the goals for each sprint and each release. The product owner also describes all the requirements and acceptance criteria. He or she must be available to participate in every sprint event and have a senior role in the organisation such that they command a level of authority so that they alone can make prioritisation decisions. They have a responsibility to accept requirements when they are done as well as helping to identify bugs and create new stories.
The best product owners are:

* **Outcomes-oriented**: able to clearly describe the desired business outcomes impacted by the business application, able to set sprint goals that inspire the development team.
* **Well-respected**: able to make prioritisation decisions without deferring to someone else, and holds significant influence over the intended application users.
* **Narrators**: able to describe the business requirements and acceptance criteria in sufficient detail that the features can be developed, tested and accepted.
* **Entrusted**: has integrity and is trusted by other senior stakeholders to balance competing priorities.
* **Readily-available**: can attend all the sprint ceremonies, the daily standups, and is frequently available for questions regarding stories and features.
* **Delegators**: no man is an island. The best product owners distibute workloads so as not to overwhelm any single team member or themselves.
* **Conflict Resolvers**: as a product owner, you have to have the courage and the capability to engage when things get difficult. And know this: you generally have to go through conflict to get to a solution. You'll need to be collaborative to minimize the negative, and you'll need to mediate effectively.

With these attributes, engaging with a product owner can seem intimidating. Know this, product owners want results, and they typically want them quickly. Don't expect a favourable outcome if you're two weeks behind in your sprints and your backlog is longer than the sum of your user stories. Product owners will be reasonable ... to a point, but to keep them engaged and active in the project they can't be distracted by other competing elements.
