The success of any organization in how they can keep Customers happy and as BC Government Employees, it is our ultimate motive to keep the Citizens of British Columbia happy and well served with digital easy-to-use services. 

Being Agile and Adopting a DevOps culture helps in delivering high valued digital services to your customers by improving the following Key Performance Indicators:

1. **Deployment Frequency** : This indicates how frequently can your team launch a new change. The more automation you have in releasing your new features, the more frequently can your developers push through new features ensuring your customers are satisifed and your apps are rid of bugs.

2. **Deployment Time**: This indicates the time required for a change to be deployed once it has been approved, more there is automation, less the time required for the change to get to production. This would allow your developer to start working on the next change/feature/update.

3. **Mean Time to Failure (MTTF)**: This denotes how often the deployment fails or how often there are outages in your deployment process. This time should be kept to the minimum. Low number of changes and high MTTFs suggest it is time to check your deployment process.

4. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: This denotes the time required to fix failed deployments or even failed changes to Production due to any given reason. This should be kept small to ensure that your response and recovery from failure is quick with little or no impact to the application.

5. **Change Failure Rate**: This indicates the rate at which any changes made to the application lead to unexpected outages. A high change failure rate in production could indicate that your lower environments might not be as close to production as you wish them to be or can suggest poor stability in your application.

6. **Time to Detection**: This indicates the time required on an average to detect the cause of your change failure or even to detect there was a failure. This indicates the significance of having monitoring and alerting systems configured as well as solid testing in place in order to catch potential issues at a very early stage, maybe even before they occur. High Times to detect failures could result in bottlenecks and interrupt other activities your team is focusing on.

7. **Lead Time**: Lead time denotes the time taken to make a change beginning with initiating the idea, designing the feature, coding, testing and then running a pipeline for the change until it is in Production. Longer lead times could suggest an inability to keep up with user demands.

8. **Defect Escape Ratio**: This indicated the rate at which defects can be caught in your software development and deployment lifecycle. Sometimes, it happens too late and is caught by end users. In order to ensure this scenario doesn't arise, it is important to have unit testing and integration testing, automated and included in your development and deployment life cycle. It could be highly beneficial to follow a Test Driven or Behavior Driven Development approach where you begin by coding to fix failed tests. This could help you mitigate several potential issues before they even occur.
