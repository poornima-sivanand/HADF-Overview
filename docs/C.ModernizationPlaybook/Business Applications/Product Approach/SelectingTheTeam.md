Which teams do you anticipate providing input/support in the development and management of the CRM? You want a team that not only checks all of the competencies boxes but also works well together and is synergistic in their work orchestration efforts. Team agility is the holy grail of team competencies, being able to shift directions at a moments notice without faltering. Pull together a group of  people to work on any project, and they will develop a culture of their own, and it will be as unique as the people in the group.
The ideal team is:

* **Results oriented**: If your team members aren't rowing in the same direction, you could be going in circles. Your team needs to see the target before they get there so they can work as one to fufill the requirements of the solution in real time.
* **Communicative**: This may be a given, but often we neglect the importance of communication when choosing our team members. A high performing team needs to be open about their thoughts and actions to be efficient on tasks and outcomes. Poor communication leads to crossed-wires and missed opportunities.
* **Supportive**: No man (person) is left behind. Good team members support one another and provide assistance when necessary to ensure that moral is maintained at a high level and the project stays on course. A team that sticks together, works together.
* **Fun**: Building a positive relationship with your colleagues can make for a much more relaxed environment and reduce conflict. Personality selection during recruitment is not a trivial exercise which means effort needs to be put into discovering each prospective team members emotional intellect. It is often better to select someone who is OK at coding but is outgoing and likeable than one who is a great at coding but prefers to be a loner.
