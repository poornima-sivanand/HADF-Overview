## Selecting the Platform​

A CRM is supposed to streamline business processes, particularly in the way of sales and marketing. With that in mind, you need to identify your business bottlenecks before you begin your hunt for a CRM. Start by “evaluating your existing business processes and their outcomes, then compare them to their desired outcomes and business objectives to determine the gap." Create a "wish list" of goals that you want in a CRM. Determine which items are high priority and which are "nice-to-haves," then refer to that list when comparing potential solutions to determine which features and which product will help you best accomplish your goals. 
Rarely is there a one-size-fits-all solution; be expected to accept compromises when it comes to looking for a CRM platform that doesn't check all  of your boxes.
The ideal CRM platform is:
* **Manageable**: Customer relationship management software is about managing your relationships with your customers and clients. Users can manage each customer case individually and efficiently to improve customer satisfaction levels. You have a CRM because your customers are like your assets; maage them effectively and they will help you grow your business.
* **Integrateable**: Your CRM of choice should not require you to put in a lot of work upfront. A good CRM is a CRM which lets you quickly and easily import data from existing databases. Instead of wasting time copying info from various sources by hand, you should be able to get straight to business and put you CRM to good use right off the bat. Your CRM should also be able to link directly with your existing email contacts with little to no effort.
* **Useable**: Even the best CRM system is useless if your employees don't know how to use it. When deciding between CRM solutions make sure that the one you pick is easy to use, has an intuitive interface, ample documentation and good user support. The time spent training your employees to use your CRM should be as short as possible - after all, the whole point of having a CRM is increasing efficiency, rather than wasting time.
* **Future Proof**: If you're thinking about getting a CRM, you are also obviously planning to grow your business. This is why you should make sure that whichever CRM you choose is easily adaptable to your future needs. A good CRM doesn't just fit your company's current needs, but also has the potential to grow with you: it should include multiple modules, features and possibilites for integration.
* **Reportable**: A good CRM should let you analyze customer & employee activites and use the information for the benefit of your company. This is why the CRM you choose should have reporting and tracking features.

## Implementation Options

### On Prem
 
One of the options for implementing a CRM solution is building a custom one.
 
#### Pros
 
  1. Ability to customize and build features that are essential to your organization
  2. Complete control on your systems and data
 
#### Cons
 
  1. You need to set up an agile team to iteratively develop and manage the custom build solution
  2. The time and cost taken to custom build a CRM solution are on the higher side
  3. You might end up reinventing the wheel
 

### Cloud
 
  According to a study by IBM, 88% of CRM solutions were on premise and custom build in 2008 whereas 87% are cloud based today. By choosing to move towards a Cloud CRM or SaaS solution, you are relieved off installing, configuring and maintaining your own servers and infrastructure for the CRM solution. You only pay for the licenses per the number of users.
 
#### Pros
 
1. Lower upfront cost
 2. The installation, maintenance, upgrades, back-ups, integration and resolution of technical issues are all managed by the vendor.
3. Quicker deployment process.
4. Flexibility of payment – you can increase or decrease subscriptions as and when required.
 
#### Cons
 
1. Possible vendor lock-in
