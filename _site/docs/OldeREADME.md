What is this?

Here you will find high-level types of applications or systems deployed in Government.  We have taken the liberty of providing here a first-cut definition of those types for your feedback.  The purpose of "typing" our applications is to illustrate potential for re-use across Government.  The source for this categorization is information about approximately 1,600 applications held by the Digital Investment office within the OCIO.

For those familiar with capability modeling, the categorizations presented here are very (very) loosely related, but are not intended to present a model of the things that Government must do well to be effective.  That is another exercise.
